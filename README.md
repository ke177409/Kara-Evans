# About Me 
Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kara. I'm a data analyst with an interest in exploring science-related topics and troubleshooting tough problems. 
Over the past eight years, I have worked mostly in biomedical laboratories, where I handled patient data, interpreted results, and performed investigations. I decided to lean in to the analytical side of my science background with an education in data analytics to improve my investigative abilities. I'm a creative thinker, which IÂ believe is a result of being a left-handed person living in a right-handed world. I like to develop my own solutions and go against the "norm" because the best answer usually isn't the obvious answer.

## Check out my [portfolio](https://ke177409.github.io/Kara-Evans/) & [resume](https://github.com/ke177409/Kara-Evans/blob/main/images/Evans.Kara%20Resume.pdf) to learn about my most recent projects!
