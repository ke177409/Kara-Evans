# [SNAP Policies and Participation: Project Overview](https://ke177409.github.io/Kara-Evans/Projects/SNAP-Policies-and-Participation)
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally funded initiative collaborating with states to provide monthly food benefits to low-income individuals and households. Following welfare reform legislation in 1996, states gained greater autonomy in administering SNAP, leading to variances in state programs. This analysis aims to spotlight the evolution of policies in states with elevated participation rates. The premise is that as states adopt more accommodating policies for recipients, SNAP participation rates are likely to increase.

Insights include relationships between SNAP recipient groups, relationships between different policies, and identification of policies potentially affecting participation rates. Python was used to clean data, perform exploratory analysis, and create visualizations to detect relationships between different variables. Tableau was used to develop a user-friendly dashboard and supplemental visualizations.

# [Medical Staffing Plan: Project Overview](https://ke177409.github.io/Kara-Evans/Projects/Medical-Staffing-Plan)
Hospitals and clinics face a substantial influx of patients during influenza seasons, placing significant demands on healthcare staff and patients seeking treatment. To address this challenge, I developed a strategic plan to assist a staffing agency in efficiently deploying medical personnel across the United States during influenza seasons.

Data cleansing and statistical analyses were performed on U.S. Census and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. I created an interactive dashboard enabling decision makers to make data-driven choices when identifying areas most affected by influenza outbreaks.
