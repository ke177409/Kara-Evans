# About Me 
Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kara. I'm a data analyst with an interest in science-related topics and troubleshooting tough problems. 
Over the past eight years, I have mostly worked in biomedical laboratories where I was tasked to handle patient data, interpret results, and perform investigations. I decided to lean in to the analytical side of my science background with an education in data analytics to improve my investigative abilities. I'm a creative thinker which IÂ believe is a result of being a left-handed person living in a right-handed world. I like to create my own solutions and go against the "norm" because the best answer usually isn't the obvious answer.
