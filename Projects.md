# [SNAP Policies and Participation: Project Overview](https://ke177409.github.io/Kara-Evans/Projects/SNAP-Policies-and-Participation)
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a federally funded initiative collaborating with states to provide monthly food benefits to low-income individuals and households. Following welfare reform legislation in 1996, states gained greater autonomy in administering SNAP, leading to variances in state programs. This analysis aims to spotlight the evolution of policies in states with elevated participation rates. The premise is that as states adopt more accommodating policies for recipients, SNAP participation rates are likely to increase.

I conducted a thorough analysis aimed at identifying shifts in state policies and participation rates over time. Insights include relationships between SNAP recipient groups, relationships between different policies, and identification of policies potentially affecting participation rates. Python was used to clean data, perform exploratory analysis, and create data visualizations to detect relationships between different variables. Tableau was used to develop a user-friendly dashboard and supplemental visualizations.

# [Medical Staffing Plan: Project Overview](https://ke177409.github.io/Kara-Evans/Projects/Medical-Staffing-Plan)
In the United States, hospitals and clinics face a substantial influx of patients during influenza seasons, placing significant demands on both healthcare staff and patients seeking treatment. To address this challenge, I developed a strategic plan to assist a staffing agency in efficiently deploying medical personnel across the country during influenza seasons.

I conducted data cleansing and comprehensive statistical analyses on data obtained from the United States Census and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outcome of this effort was the creation of an interactive dashboard, leveraging Tableau's capabilities to present insightful visualizations. These visualizations served as a valuable resource for decision-makers, enabling them to make data-driven choices when deploying medical staff to areas most affected by influenza outbreaks.

Customer purchase data was analyzed to increase outreach and yield higher profits for an online grocery service. The results encompassed optimal advertising timeframes, top-selling products, and customer demographic profiles. In the process of preparing data for exploratory analysis, I merged data frames and generated new variables using Python. Additionally, I created data visualizations in Python to effectively depict the relationships between various variables.

Customer behavior and geographic data were analyzed for a movie rental comany in preparation for the launch of a new online streaming service. The analysis yielded valuable insights, including the identification of key geographical markets for promoting the company's brand, the top-earning films, and the recognition of loyal customers. To achieve these findings, I employed SQL to efficiently organize, clean, filter, and integrate data, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and geographic sales data. Subsequently, I harnessed these SQL results to craft informative visualizations using Tableau.
