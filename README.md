# About Me 
Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kara. I'm a **data analyst** with an interest in exploring science-related topics and troubleshooting tough problems. 

Over the past eight years, I have worked mostly in biomedical laboratories, where I handled patient data, interpreted results, and performed investigations. I decided to lean in to the analytical side of my science background with an education in data analytics to improve my investigative abilities. During this process I have bolstered my analytical skills with **statistical analyses** and **machine learning** methods using **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Tableau**.

I'm a creative thinker, which IÂ believe is a result of being a left-handed person living in a right-handed world. I like to develop my own solutions and go against the "norm" because the best answer usually isn't the obvious answer.
