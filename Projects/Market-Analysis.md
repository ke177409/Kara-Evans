# Market Analysis: Project Overview
Evaluated historical international video game sales data to identify trends in game genre popularity, sales figures for different geographic regions, and market competitors. Findings include regional sales trends, proportion of regional sales to global sales, and top-selling video game publishers. Used Excel to filter, sort, and clean data. Generated PivotTables to create new variables and visualizations.

## Tools & Skills
Excel
* Data quality checks
* Descriptive and exploratory analyses
* PivotTables
  
Data Storytelling
* PowerPoint presentation format
* Deliver insights that challenge stakeholder expectations

## Purpose & Context
I performed an exploratory analysis to answer key stakeholder questions. I was responsible for deciding on the project scope and final presentation format. This project was a part of 
CareerFoundryâ€™s Data Immersion curriculum and was evaluated with feedback by a tutor and mentor.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
* Removed duplicates.
* Removed columns with irrelevant data.
* Imputed averages in columns for regional sales with partially missing data.
* Removed empty rows.
* Reformatted columns and values for consistency.
* Labelled blank values as "N/A".

## Visualizations
The stakeholders assume North America will continue to dominate the global market based on historical sales data. This line graph displays the number of video games sold per year from 1983 to 2016. North America, Europe, and Japan are the top selling regions and were included in this anaylsis. All regions saw a decline in sales beginning in 2009. North America and Europe sales converge in 2015 indicating a shift in the global market.

## Recommendations & Findings
* Europe makes up most of the global market over North America and Japan.
* Shooter genres were the most popular in Europe and North America.
  * Action genres were popular in all three regions.
* Develop more Shooter games to satisfy the larger European and North American markets.
* A secondary focus on Action genres to satisfy all three regions.
* Perform further analysis to address competing publishing companies in each region.
