# [Medical Staffing Plan: Project Overview](https://ke177409.github.io/Kara-Evans/Projects/Medical-Staffing-Plan)
In the United States, hospitals and clinics face a substantial influx of patients during influenza seasons, placing significant demands on both healthcare staff and patients seeking treatment. To address this challenge, I developed a strategic plan to assist a staffing agency in efficiently deploying medical personnel across the country during influenza seasons.

I conducted data cleansing and comprehensive statistical analyses on data obtained from the United States Census and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outcome of this effort was the creation of an interactive dashboard, leveraging Tableau's capabilities to present insightful visualizations. These visualizations served as a valuable resource for decision-makers, enabling them to make data-driven choices when deploying medical staff to areas most affected by influenza outbreaks.
