# About Me 
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kara. I'm a **data analyst** with an interest in exploring science-related topics and troubleshooting tough problems. I'm a creative thinker, which IÂ believe is a result of being a left-handed person living in a right-handed world. I like to develop my own solutions and go against the "norm" because the best answer usually isn't the obvious answer.

Over the past eight years, I have worked mostly in biomedical laboratories, where I handled patient data, interpreted results, and performed investigations. I decided to lean into the analytical side of my science background with an education in data analytics to improve my investigative abilities. During this process I have bolstered my analytical skills with **statistical analyses** and **machine learning** methods using **Excel**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Tableau**.

My professional experience has driven my desire to continue working in the healthcare industry. I'm a self-starter and plan to further my data skills so that I can analyze patient data and improve software systems that impact the patient experience.

My biggest motivation is helping others, even if it's just locating that missing document or resolving a minor technical problem. I'm seeking to enhance my abilities to support my future team members and also improve the lives of the people they serve.

**I'm located in Cleveland, Ohio seeking a full-time position and open to hybrid or remote opportunities.**
