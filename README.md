# About Me 
Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Kara. I'm a data analyst with an interest in science-related topics and troubleshooting tough problems. 
Over the past eight years, I have mostly worked in biomedical laboratories where I was tasked to handle patient data, interpret results, and perform investigations. My education includes a **Certificate on Data Analytics** and a **Bachelor's in Biological Sciences**. 
I'm a creative thinker which IÂ believe is a result of being a left-handed person living in a right-handed world. I like to create my own solutions and go against the "norm". My excellent critical thinking has helped me take the lead on projects and tackle any challenges.Â
